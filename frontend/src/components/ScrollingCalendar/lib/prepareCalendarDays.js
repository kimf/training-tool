 * Prepare the array of days that will be used to display events on the calendar.
 * Each event must have the properties:
 *  - start
 *  - end
 *  - title
 *  - id
 * They can also have an "expanded" property to indicate they should be expanded by default
 *
 * For each day, we need to have the  collection of events for that day, with indicators:
 *  - length in week (the # of days for that event)
 *  - first in week (indicates this is the first day for the event in the current week)
 *  - expanded (indicates that the item should be expanded by default)
 *  - offset (an optional positive offset for events that need to have an additional margin so that they don't overlap later ones)
 * The events must be sorted by date, then by stage
